## Almond Croissant Blog

This is the first and potentially the only iteration of the almond croissant blog that I started a looong time ago.

It runs within a free static web app within my azure subscription. 

It is built within a github pipeline and pushed out onto the static web app. 


The url for the static web app - https://kind-hill-0a1691d03.5.azurestaticapps.net

The dockerfile for the build sits within the .devcontainer directory and the github pipelines are withing the .github/workflows directory.
