We are using a really rudimentary scoring system, we are trying to keep it as objective as possible. We have good days and bad days but hopefully these are tempered to give an honest score of each establishment.

The places we visit will also have good and bad days too so we try to be fair and honest too.

Hopefully all of the below scoring makes sense, we are scoring the business as the place we are going to visit does play an important part in wanting to go back and enjoy other baked goods.

The Price scoring system may change as they all score the same as the ranges are too big!

Size /5
- width of hand = 2 points
- Length of hand = 2 points

Crumb /5
- visual
- Distribution of crumb (almonds, icing sugar, etc.)
- Burnt or crisp

Pastry /5
- laminations
- Crisp
- Flavour
- Texture 

Filling /5
- amount
- Texture
- Flavour
- Moisture

Price /5
- how much it costs with a cappuccino
    - £6 > 5/5
    - £7 > 4/5
    - £8 > 3/5
    - £9 > 2/5 
    - £10 > 1/5

Business /5
- this can score above 5 but if it does, it should be rounded down to 5, as there are all important to making the experience enjoyable
- Accessibility - how is it for people who might have difficulties with something? (Sight, movement, etc) - 1.5
- Staff - friendliness, hygiene, order success, etc - 1.5
- Location - 1.5 
- Environment - are there places to sit, space to queue, noise levels, patronage, bakery visible - 1.5
