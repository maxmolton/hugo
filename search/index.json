Obviously we took any excuse to head down to Hart\u0026rsquo;s Bakery, nestled under one of the arches on the approach to Bristol Temple Meads, for a Cappucino and an Almond Croissant.\nThe Almond Croissants at Hart\u0026rsquo;s are slightly different to other almond croissants as they are not baked as regular croissants and then sliced open, almond filling inserted and rebaked. The almond filling is baked inside from the start.\n# Harts Bakery - 26.5/30 28/03/24 - C\nCategory Score/5 Size 4.5 Crumb 4 Pastry 5 Filling 4 Price 4 Business 5 The filling was good although it had bunched out at the ends of the croissant instead of evenly throughout, this meant we were lacking filling in the centre. The pastry was unbeatable and possibly the best pastry we have had on our adventures. Overall this was a fantastic almond Croissant.\n","date":"2024-03-28T00:00:00Z","image":"https://kind-hill-0a1691d03.5.azurestaticapps.net/p/harts-bakery-280324/harts_280324_hu15668c98dc78b9fbe9142317b20643e8_432912_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://kind-hill-0a1691d03.5.azurestaticapps.net/p/harts-bakery-280324/","title":"Harts Bakery"},{"content":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.\n# Headings The following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;—\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\n# H1 # H2 # H3 # H4 # H5 # H6 # Paragraph Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.
